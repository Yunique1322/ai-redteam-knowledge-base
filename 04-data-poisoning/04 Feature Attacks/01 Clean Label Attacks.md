# Clean Label Attacks

## The idea, and how it differs from label flipping

Label attacks changed the labels. **A clean-label attack leaves every label correct and instead perturbs the features.** That makes it far stealthier: anyone auditing the training labels sees nothing wrong, because the poison lives in the feature values, not the answers. It is also inherently targeted, the goal is to make one specific target instance get misclassified at inference.

The manufacturing example is the clearest way to hold it: you want an `Acceptable` batch (true Class 1) to be rejected as `Major Defect` (Class 0). So you take training points that are genuinely labeled `Major Defect` (Class 0), and **nudge their length/weight features toward the `Acceptable` region, while keeping their Class 0 label.** Now the training set contains "Class 0" points sitting inside Class 1 territory.

## Why it works (short intuition)

The model still has to label those perturbed points correctly, and their label says Class 0. To get them right while they sit in Class 1's neighborhood, **the model is forced to bend the 0/1 boundary outward to swallow them, and that bulge sweeps up the real Acceptable target on the wrong side.** You moved the boundary without ever touching a single label. Direction to remember: you perturb points of the class you want the target _mislabeled as_, and drag them toward the target's true region.

### You cannot touch the target

**The target is not yours to move.** It's a real `Acceptable` part that shows up later, at inference time, as someone else's input. You only control the **training data**, and you also can't change labels (that's the "clean" rule). So moving the target is off the table.

Since you can't move the point, the only lever left is: **move the _boundary_ so the stationary target ends up on the wrong side of it.**

### How planting class-0 points moves the boundary

The model is forced to label every training point correctly. So if you sprinkle points that are **labeled Class 0** into Class 1's territory, the model has no choice but to stretch the "Class 0" region outward to cover them, because their label insists they're Class 0. That stretch drags the 0/1 boundary deeper into Class 1 space, sweeping right over your target. The target hasn't moved an inch, but the border has crossed it, so now it falls inside the Class 0 region and gets predicted Major Defect (rejected). Goal achieved, no label touched, target never touched.

Analogy: the boundary is a fence between two countries. You can't move the enemy villager (the target). But if you plant _your own country's flags_ just past the fence, the mapmaker redraws the border to include your flags, and in doing so the new border swallows the villager into your side.

## Setup and 3-class dataset

New this section: three classes (0/1/2), and new imports that foreshadow what's coming, `OneVsRestClassifier` (the multi-class model in the next section) and `NearestNeighbors` (used later to craft the perturbation). Full setup cell:

One thing worth noting versus the label-attack sections: **scaling is applied here before the split matters more now, because the feature perturbations you craft later are measured in this standardized space.**

## `plot_data_multi`

A multi-class plotter with optional point highlighting. You will use `highlight_indices` later to mark the target instance and the perturbed poison points, and the `'P'` marker is given a higher z-order so poison points draw on top of everything. Full function:

The plot shows three reasonably separated clusters (Class 0 azure top-left, Class 1 yellow bottom-middle, Class 2 red top-right). That separation is deliberate, it makes the boundary shift from the coming attack easy to see.

Key point: ==clean-label = features perturbed, labels untouched, stealthy, targeted, and it works by forcing the boundary to bend around mislabeled-looking-but-correctly-labeled points.==
